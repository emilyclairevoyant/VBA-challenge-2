# VBA-challenge

Description
This repository includes the code and results from it that is made to automatically determine the change in price of stocks, along with the percent change and total stock volume. It also includes automatic calculations of which stock returned the most and least percent increase and the greatest stock volume in a separate section of the worksheet. It also automatically color codes the change, green being positive change and red being negative.

Screenshots are included displaying the results from the code on each spreadsheet, all of which are named after the according sheet for easy viewing.
